      Our objective at Gîte les 3 fleurs is to bring together our visitors'
      societies and spirits with our own, communicating enthusiasm and
      liberality in the food we share. Official Chef and Owner Anthony
      Woodbridge superbly creates a blend of Lebanese, Levantine,
      Mediterranean-motivated food blended with New York mentality. Delightful
      herbs and flavors consolidate surfaces to pacify wide-based palates.
